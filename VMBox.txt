Virtual Machine (VM) - Overview
A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications just like a physical machine. VMs allow you to create multiple isolated environments on a single physical host, each with its own virtual hardware configuration. This virtualization technology provides several advantages, such as the ability to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine, easy migration of VMs between different hosts, and improved resource utilization.

The virtualization layer called the hypervisor is responsible for managing the VMs and enabling communication between them and the underlying physical hardware. There are two types of hypervisors: Type 1 hypervisor (bare-metal) runs directly on the physical hardware, while Type 2 hypervisor runs on top of an existing operating system.

Oracle VirtualBox - Overview
Oracle VirtualBox is a popular Type 2 hypervisor that allows you to create and manage virtual machines on your desktop or laptop. It supports a wide range of guest operating systems, including Windows, Linux, macOS, and more. VirtualBox is free and open-source, making it an excellent choice for developers, testers, and anyone interested in exploring virtualization.

How to Install VirtualBox on Windows

Step 1: Download VirtualBox

Installing Ubuntu 22.04 in VirtualBox
1. Download the Ubuntu 22.04 image from https://www.osboxes.org/.
2. Create a new VM in VirtualBox and configure it with the downloaded image.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Ubuntu.

Installing Nginx in Ubuntu
1. Open the terminal in Ubuntu (Ctrl + Alt + T).
2. Update the package list:
   sudo apt update
3. Install Nginx:
   sudo apt install nginx
4. Start Nginx:
   sudo systemctl start nginx
5. Enable Nginx to start on boot:
   sudo systemctl enable nginx
6. Verify the installation by accessing http://localhost in your web browser.

Scanning the VM with Nmap
1. Find the VM's IP address using the command:
   ip a
2. On the host machine, use Nmap to scan the VM:
   nmap <VM-IP-address>
3. Observe the open ports in the scan results.
